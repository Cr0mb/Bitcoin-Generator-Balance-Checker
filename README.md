These projects are intended solely for educational purposes to help individuals understand the principles of cryptography and blockchain technology. It is important to recognize that attempting to generate Bitcoin wallets in the hope of randomly finding one with a balance is not a feasible strategy. This same logic applies to any tool that tries to work in any way the same as this.

The number of possible Bitcoin wallet combinations exceeds 76 trillion, making the odds of discovering an active wallet astronomically low. To put it into perspective, you are statistically far more likely to win the lottery every day for the rest of your life than to recover even a single wallet with fundsâ€”even over the course of a decade.

## Updates

| Issue | Solution |
|--------|------------|
| **Multiple API calls even after success** | Stop checking APIs after the first successful response. |
| **Potential JSON corruption in `wallets.json`** | Use a temporary file for atomic writes. |
| **Incorrect SegWit address generation** | Corrected Bech32 encoding of hashed public key. |
| **Improper Mnemonic derivation** | Used proper entropy source for BIP-39 compliance. |
| **Unsafe script termination** | Handle `KeyboardInterrupt` to exit cleanly. |
| **Long API failure wait (20 min delay)** | Removed `time.sleep(1200)` and continued execution. |
| **Lack of logging/debugging tools** | Added logging to track wallet generation and issues. |


# Bitcoin Generator & Balance Checker

This Python script generates Bitcoin wallets, displays relevant wallet information, and checks the balance for both Legacy and SegWit addresses using multiple public APIs.

## Features
- Generates a random Bitcoin private key and corresponding public key.
- Derives Bitcoin Legacy (P2PKH) and SegWit (P2WPKH/P2SH) addresses from the public key.
- Displays the mnemonic phrase for wallet recovery.
- Fetches and displays transaction history and unspent transactions from multiple public APIs.
- Includes a delay to handle rate limits and API blacklisting (waits for 20 minutes if blacklisted).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
```
pip install ecdsa hashlib base58 mnemonic bech32 requests colorama
```

The script will start generating wallets continuously and display the following information:

> Mnemonic Phrase (for wallet recovery)

> Private Key (in hexadecimal format)

> Public Key (in hexadecimal format)

> Legacy Address (P2PKH)

> SegWit Address (P2WPKH/P2SH)
